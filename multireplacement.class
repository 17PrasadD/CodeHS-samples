/*
to use these functions, copy the part below.

//Copy this part:

    public void moveSpaces(number){
        for (int i = 0; i < number; ++i){
            move();
        }
    }
    public void turnSpaces(number){
        for (int i = 0; i < number; ++i){
            turnLeft();
        }
    }
	
/*Then, instead of having to type move(); or turnLeft(); multiple times, you can just do moveSpaces(numberOfSpaces); or turnSpaces(numberOfTurns);

E.G.

instead of:
move();
move();
move();
move();

to move 4 times, you could do:

moveSpaces(4);

the same holds true for turnSpaces



How it works:
	public void moveSpaces(number){
	}
	^ This creates the method named moveSpaces.(number) is what we call a parameter. For example, when you type moveSpaces(4); the method replaces number with 4.
	
	
	for (int i = 0; i < number; ++i){
            move();
        }
	^ This creates a for loop that repeats the command within it (in this case move();) as many times as the number parameter (in this case 4).
